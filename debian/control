Description: ParaType Sans font family
 PT Sans is a type family of universal use. It consists of 8 styles:
 regular and bold weights with corresponding italics form a standard
 computer font family; two narrow styles (regular and bold) are intended
 for documents that require tight set; two caption styles (regular and
 bold) are for texts of small point sizes. The design combines
 traditional conservative appearance with modern trends of humanistic
 sans serif and characterized by enhanced legibility. These features
 beside conventional use in business applications and printed stuff made
 the fonts quite useable for direction and guide signs, schemes, screens
 of information kiosks and other objects of urban visual communications.
 .
 The fonts next to standard Latin and Cyrillic character sets contain
 signs of title languages of the national republics of Russian
 Federation and support the most of the languages of neighboring
 countries. The fonts were developed and released by ParaType in 2009
 with financial support from Federal Agency of Print and Mass
 Communications of Russian Federation. Design - Alexandra Korolkova with
 assistance of Olga Umpeleva and supervision of Vladimir Yefimov.
